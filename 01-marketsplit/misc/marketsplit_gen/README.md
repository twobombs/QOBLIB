# Market Split Generator

This repository provides a tool for generating feasible, random market share problem instances of arbitrary size. These instances are particularly useful for benchmarking solvers and evaluating their performance.

## Problem Definition

Given a matrix $A = [a_{ij}] \in \mathbb{N}^{m \times n}$ and a right-hand side $b = [b_i] \in \mathbb{N}^m$, determine whether there exists a solution vector $x \in \{0, 1\}^n$ such that:

$Ax = b$

This problem becomes challenging when the entries of $b$ are set as:

$b_i = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum_{j \in [n]} a_{ij}}{2} \right\rfloor$

Here, $b_i$ is computed as half the sum of the entries in the corresponding row of $A$, rounded down.

## Generating Instances

To benchmark solvers, it is essential to generate feasible instances of this problem. A naive approach is to randomly sample the entries of $A$ from a uniform distribution and compute $b$ accordingly. However, this approach often results in infeasible instances, which are less useful for benchmarking.

This repository provides an improved method to generate feasible instances by constructing them as follows:

### Procedure to Generate Feasible Instances

1. **Generate a Random Solution Vector**:  
   Create a random solution vector $x$ where approximately half (Â±2) of the entries are set to $1$, and the rest are set to $0$.

2. **Generate Matrix $A$**:  
   Sample the entries of $A$ uniformly from a specified range.

3. **Compute the Right-Hand Side $b$**:  
   Compute each entry of $b$ as:
   $b_i = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum_{j \in [n]} a_{ij}}{2} \right\rfloor$

4. **Adjust for Feasibility**:  
   Ensure feasibility of the generated instance using the following steps for each row:
   
   - **Step 1**: Repeat until no more improvement is possible:
     - Identify a pair of entries in the row where one corresponds to $0$ in $x$ and the other to $1$.
     - Perform a "switch" that reduces the absolute slack of the row as much as possible.

   - **Step 2**: If the row is still not feasible:
     - Calculate the slack $s$ for the row.
     - Set $c = \frac{3 \cdot \text{numones}}{2}$, where `num_ones` is the number of $1$'s in the row.
     - Find $c$ pairs of $0$ and $1$, and adjust the corresponding entries by adding $\frac{s}{c}$ to the $1$'s and subtracting it from the $0$'s.

   - **Step 3**: Repeat this adjustment until the row becomes feasible.

In most cases, only a few switches and adjustments are sufficient to achieve feasibility.

## Why Use This Method?

This method ensures that the generated instances:
- Are guaranteed to be feasible.
- Provide a diverse range of problems for benchmarking.
- Avoid the high infeasibility rates of naive random generation methods.
