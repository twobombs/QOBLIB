# Models for Market Split

Each folder contains a model for the market split problem described [here](./../README.md).
Moreover, each of the folders contains a script that generates all the files for the instances (`.lp`, `.qs`, ...) and puts them into an archive. 

Please always have an archive with all problem instances for your formulation in the corresponding folder.
