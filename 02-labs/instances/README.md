# Instances for LABS

## Instance Generation

Since there is only a single instance of the LABS problem for each sequence length and we do not want to specify the mathematical model, no instances are included in this folder.

Please refer to the [models](./../models/) directory, where various models are presented. Each model includes a downloadable archive containing the compiled instances.
