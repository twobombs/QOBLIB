# Steiner Tree Packing Problem

## Problem Description

This problem asks for a packing of Steiner trees with given terminals
in a graph. There are multiple versions of the Steiner Tree Packing
(STP) problem. The specific version discussed here is usually referred
to as a switchbox problem on a square grid (all terminals are on the
edges of the square), multi-layer (there are several square grids
stacked on top of each other), with holes (some parallelepipedal
sections of the 3D graph are removed), node-disjoint (each Steiner
tree in the packing must use disjoing nodes).
