# Instances for Sports Tournament Scheduling

## Format Description

Problem instances follow a somewhat simplified version of the RobinXML format (see [1] for the simplified version, and [2] for the full description). 

## Instance Generation

All instances in this directory were generated with a random instance generator developed for the International Timetabling Competition 2021 (ITC2021, see [3]).
All instances are feasible by construction.
Particular attention has been given to ensure that the instances are *diverse*, *challenging*, and *real-world like*, using the framework of instance space analysis (see [3], [4], and [5]).
