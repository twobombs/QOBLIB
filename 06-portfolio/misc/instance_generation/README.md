# Instance Generation

All instances can be generated using the `python main.py` script here. 
Adjust the following parameters to customize instance generation:

- **Time Range**:
  - **Location**: `retrieve_stock_data` method in `main.py`
  - **Adjustment**: Set `start_date` and `window_size`. The first day is calculated as `start_date + window_size`.

- **Window Size**:
  - **Location**: `generate_daily_covariance_matrices` method in `data_preparation.py`
  - **Adjustment**: Modify the `window_size` parameter to change the number of days for covariance calculations.

- **Number of Stocks**:
  - **Location**: `get_top_companies_by_market_cap` method in `data_retrieval.py`
  - **Adjustment**: Set the `top_n` parameter to pick n top companies based on market capitalization.

Tee generated instances will be written to `instances/new/` for safety. I
If everything looks good, run `./clean_up.sh ./../../instances/new ./../../instances`.
This can overwrite old instances!

# Instance Comparison

After the instances have been generated, you can compare them by using the `compare_instances.py` script.
Just change the path to the newly generated instances and the instances will be compared.
Note, that the `combined_stock_data.csv` file must be present for this to work. 
This file is automatically generated by the instance generation described above.
