# Model overview

## Introduction

This repository contains scripts and parameter files for conducting experiments in Binary Quadratic Programming (BQP) and Unconstrained Quadratic Optimization (UQO). The primary objective is to adjust quadratic coefficients, generate corresponding problem files, and solve them using appropriate optimization solvers. This comprehensive setup facilitates the evaluation and comparison of optimization techniques under varying parameters and constraints.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following primary directories:

- `binary_quadratic_programming/`
- `unconstrained_quadratic_optimization/`

Each directory contains scripts specific to BQP and UQO problems, respectively.
The model is described [here](./../info/model_setting.pdf).
