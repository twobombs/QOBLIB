# Instances for Stable Set

## Instance Format

This file describes the format in which the instances within the "instances" directory are saved.

The instances are stored as the graphs belonging to the MISP using the standard DIMACS graph format.
The first k lines starting with the letter 'c' describe comment lines, that are used to give information about the graph and can be ignored when processing the graph.
After that a single line in the form "p edge n m" follows, where n and m are the amount of nodes and edges of the graph respectively.
The file ends with m lines in the form "e v_i v_j" that describe the (undirected) edge between nodes v_i and v_j. Nodes are numberd from 1 to n.

The following illustrates an example graph.

```
c A beautiful and complicated graph!
c :)
p edge 3 2
e 1 2
e 2 3
```

**IMPORTANT.** The DIMACS graphs, i.e.: brock200_2, brock400_1, brock800_1, C500.9, c4000.5, gen200_p0-9_44, hamming10-4, keller4, keller6, p_hat1500_1 and p_hat1500-3 have already been inverted, as they have been originally used as max clique instances. Therefore results obtained on these inverted graphs are directly comparable to the results of the original max clique problem.
