# Vehicle Routing 

## Problem Description

A fleet of $k$ vehicles with time windows and capacities in the form of a fleet with limited capacity $X$ that must 
deliver goods from a central depot to a set of customers $C = \{1,...,n\}$, each with a specific demand $d_i, i \in C$.
The objective is to determine the routes for all vehicles to minimize the total distance or cost.
We consider instances with $k=4$ and $n=20$.
