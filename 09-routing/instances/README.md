# Instances for Vehicle Routing

## Instance Generation

All instances have $n=20$ customers and the **number of vehicles is fixed at $k=4$**.

All instances were created to be $100 \%$ tight:
The sum of demands equals the capacity $X k$.

Otherwise, they are not artificial.

## Instance Format

The instances are in the TSPLIB/CVRPLIB format. [link](http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/)

## Instance Sources

The instances have been generated by Eduardo Uchoa and Eduardo Queiroga.
