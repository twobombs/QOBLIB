# Topology Design

## Problem Description

This problem can also be referred to as Graph Golf or Order/Degree Problem--see http://research.nii.ac.jp/graphgolf/
and https://research.nii.ac.jp/graphgolf/problem.html for a problem definition.

These problems aim to determine the graph with the smallest diameter among all graphs with a given number of nodes and maximum degree. 
**We do not consider the average shortest path lentth as a tiebreaker.**

For a formal description of the problem and some heuristics, see:
