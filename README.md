# Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library - QOBLIB

## Description
With the aim of enabling fair, comparable, and meaningful benchmarks for quantum optimization methods, 
we here present ten optimization problem classes that are difficult for
existing classical algorithms and can (mostly) be linked to practically-relevant applications.
While the individual properties of the problem classes  vary in terms of objective and variable type, coefficient ranges, and density, they all become
challenging for established classical methods already at system sizes in the range of about 100
to 10 000 decision variables.
This repository holds problem instances of varying complexity, exemplary model descriptions, solution track records,
and references or explicit functionality for checking solution feasibility.

## Structure
In this repository every problem class has its own folder.
The content for each problem class is structured via the following sub-folders.

- `info`        holds relevant information about the problem class such as papers.
- `instances`   holds various problem instances for the respective problem class.
                The format in which the instances are given depend on the problem class.
- `misc`        holds miscallenous files and scripts.
- `models`      holds model descriptions for problem instances given in the `instances` folder.
- `solutions`   holds solutions for problem instances given in the `instances` folder.
